Here are the instructions for generating a new Angular project with PWA support and resolving the **this.tree.readText** is not a function error:

# Generating a new Angular project with PWA support
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Angular project.
3. Run the following command to create a new Angular project with PWA support: 
```bash
ng new my-app --routing --style scss --service-worker
```
This will create a new Angular project with the `my-app` name, using SCSS for styling, and with routing and service worker support enabled.
4. After the project is generated, navigate to the project directory by running the following command: `cd my-app`
5. Run the following command to start the development server: `ng serve --open`
This will start the development server and open your new Angular project in your default web browser.

# Resolving the this.tree.readText is not a function error
If you encounter the this.tree.readText is not a function error while running the ng new command or the ng serve command, open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your Angular project is located.

Run the following command to update the @angular/cli package to the latest version:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli@latest
```

After the package is updated, try running the ng new or ng serve command again to see if the error is resolved.

That's it! I hope this helps you generate a new Angular project with PWA support and resolve any issues related to the this.tree.readText is not a function error.
